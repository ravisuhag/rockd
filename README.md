Rockstar of Design
==================
Website Redesign Project for Bigrock.in

Technology Used
===============
* Languages : HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
* CSS Framework : Twitter Bootstrap
* MVC Framework : AngularJS
* Compression : Imageoptim

Running Project
===============
You need a http server to run this project. (As anglarJS is using location and routing).
Setting Server:
- Put the github repo into an apache server and point the url to the folder.
- If you have python installed run this command from the directory
   <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>
- or you can run any other http server e.g. node, sinatra ...

Screens Implemented
====================
As per rules and guidelines the task was to design the domain purchase flow for the bigrock.in. So i focussed more on that and skipped few things like naviagtion pages, footer (Detailed version) and few other things which were not that important to domain purchase flow.

This workflow contains main following screens
--

 |-- Home Screen
 |-- Search Screen
 |-- Checkout Screen
 |   |
 |   |- SignUp View
 |   |- Signin View
 |   '- Payment View
