##Running Project
You need a http server to run this project. (As anglarJS is using location and routing).
Setting Server:
- Put the github repo into an apache server and point the url to the folder.
- If you have python installed run this command from the directory
   <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>
- or you can run any other http server using node, sinatra etc...

##Screens Implemented
As per rules and guidelines the task was to design the domain purchase flow for the bigrock.in. So i focussed more on that and skipped few things like naviagtion pages, footer (Detailed version) and few other things which were not that important to domain purchase flow.

This workflow contains mainly following screens
```
--
 |
 |-- Home Screen
 |-- Search Screen
 |-- Checkout Screen
 |   |
 |   |- Order Summary
 |   |- SignUp View
 |   |- Signin View
 |   '- Payment View
 |
 '--Payment Success
```
## Quick Routes 
Check following routes. These routes are realtive to the root path of the project repo on your server. 
 - <code>/</code> Main page
 - <code>#/search</code> Search Page
 - <code>#/checkout</code> Checkout Page
 - <code>#/purchasedone</code> Payment Done
